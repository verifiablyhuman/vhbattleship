# vhbattleship
A practice project focused on creating a Battleship game.

As a new programmer, I wanted a mildly challenging project to work on. One of the tutorials I was working on involved creating a simple
version of a text based battleship game. To make it more challenging, I decided to add in more user input, allowing the user to choose
things such as the number of ships and their size. 

As the work of a novice, there is not too much in the way of user convenience. It is also a work in progress, so it will probably be
buggy. I have mainly put it up in case others want to look at it and provide some help. So, thanks for any help in advance.
